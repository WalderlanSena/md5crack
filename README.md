## Whats is MD5?

**MD5** (Message Digest algorithm 5) is a 128-bit unidirectional cryptographic hash function (or cryptographic hash function) developed by RSA Data Security, Inc., described in RFC 1321, and widely used by point-to- Point **(P2P, or Peer-to-Peer)** checksum for file and log integrity.

It was developed in 1991 by **Ronald Rivest** to succeed MD4 who had some security issues. Because it is a unidirectional algorithm, an md5 hash can not be transformed back into the text that gave rise to it. The verification method is then done by comparing the two hashes (one from the original trusted message and the other from the received message). MD5 is also used to check the integrity of a file through, for example, the md5sum program, which creates the hash of a file. This can be very useful for large file downloads, for P2P programs that build the file through chunks and are subject to corruption of the same. How login authentication is used on many unix operating systems and many sites with authentication. Md5 is a cryptographic function, but should not be confused with encryption. Encryption is a two-way task that you use whenever you need to securely store information, but need to retrieve it later using a symmetric or private key. Since the hash, it is commonly used when you need to compare information. *From: Wikipedia*
